TO DO LIST
Change arrow to carrot.
Arrow/Carrot is shooting more than one arrow at a time. Original code shows it shoots 1. Have reviewed and shows no difference. Have to relook.
Arrow/Carrot should start at the tip of the gun.
Better efx in killing badger or crash into castle.
Shd change castle to cabbages?
